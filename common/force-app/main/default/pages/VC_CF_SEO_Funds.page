                                How do property funds work?  </h3>
                            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When individual investors join property funds, they combine their </span><a href="https://www.venturecrowd.com.au/s/venture-capital"><span style="font-weight: 400;">venture capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the contributions of other investors. This allows more people to participate in and benefit from successful investment opportunities like large-scale residential and commercial development projects which an individual investor may not otherwise be able to access. Property funds also help protect individual investors against significant losses as less capital is required to participate. This means that there is less risk for an investor and less risk is always preferable when sourcing </span><a href="https://www.venturecrowd.com.au/s/high-yield-investments"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high yield investment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opportunities.&nbsp;</span></p>

                            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australia has joined nations like the US and New Zealand, and countries throughout Europe and Asia, by passing the legislative framework required to permit retail investors – such as yourself – to participate in a new Crowd-Sourced Funding (CSF) regime. This type of investment structure may also be referred to as </span><a href="https://www.venturecrowd.com.au/s/syndicate-investing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">syndicate investing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and consists of property funds which multiple investors contribute to as part of large </span><a href="https://www.venturecrowd.com.au/s/high-return-investments"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high return investments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> such as property development opportunities. Anyone residing in Australia and who is at least 18 years old can now invest in CSF offers made by an investment property company like VentureCrowd. We have already successfully raised capital for over 4 years from wholesale investors with over $140m raised across 100 successful deals.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what makes property funds good investment opportunities? In short, it’s the mitigation of risk. Traditionally, large scale building projects like residential developments and commercial developments have been closed to retail investors. To raise the property funds required to launch big projects, investors would have to contribute extremely large sums of investment capital. This meant that everyday investors, like you, could not access or share in something like a large </span><a href="https://www.venturecrowd.com.au/s/property/gold-coast"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold Coast property investment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> targeting key residential and business areas.

This means that 90% of your investment portfolio may not generate any investment income at all and so the remaining 10% become vital to your income generation.&nbsp;</span></p>
