                                As the world continues to feel the social and economic pressures of COVID, the importance of science and medicine as a global priority has been elevated and investment volumes into health and biotech startups have continued to grow. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The term Biotech is short for biotechnology, which is technology that utilizes biological systems and living organisms to develop or create different products. It includes things like producing new drugs, gene therapy and molecular diagnosis. A good example is the COVID vaccine  but there are also lots of other important therapies and drugs being developed to address other major life threatening conditions.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h4> <strong>Biotech discovery:</strong> </h4>
                            <p>
                                Much of the initial Biotech research starts at the university stage before being commercialised. There are four major steps Biotech’s go through, starting at innovation then moving towards profitability. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Firstly, drug discovery is the identification of potential drug candidates that new or existing therapy areas can potentially target. Then, through pre-clinical tests, the drug candidates are tested in vitro (in test tubes) and/or in vivo (against live animals, such as mice). Clinical trials can then occur over four phases. Once complete, the final step is approval by regulatory authorities. At this stage the company applies for authorisation and marketing approval from the corresponding medicines licensing agency depending on geographical location. At this stage you have incredibly valuable intellectual property which almost always has global application. So whilst it’s a high risk, being involved in a successful biotech company early can be very rewarding.  
                            </p>
                            <h4> <strong>Covid-19: BioTech’s Exponential Growth</strong> </h4>
                            <p>
                                COVID has heightened the focus of communities, and investors on the importance of medicine and science. According to McKinsey, between 2019 and 2020, biotech saw double-digit annual growth in fundraising from VCs and deals such as partnerships, and joint ventures.It also saw triple-digit growth in IPOs.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In 2020, the global BioTech &amp; pharma industry achieved a record <b>US$28.5B of capital, or a 60.5% YoY increase over 2019</b> (Pitchbook, 2021). According to Emergen Research, this industry will grow at a CAGR of 15% up to 2027, reaching a market value of over US$ 850.5 Bn by 2027. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Between January 2020 and January 2021, the average share price for European and US biotechs increased at more than twice the rate of the S&amp;P 500, and Chinese biotechs performed more than six times better, with their average share price more than doubling in a year. Overall, <b>biotech is outperforming the pharmaceutical industry, as well as many household-name consumer-goods and technology companies</b>. Because this activity continues to increase, biotech is a key focus for investors right now and we expect it will remain so over the medium term.

                            </p>

                            <h4> <strong>Australia’s place</strong> </h4>
                            <p>
                                Australia’s biotech sector is very strong and we have a long and proud history as a global leader in medical innovation. Australia is considered to be among the top 5 countries for Biotechnology in the world ahead of countries like the United Kingdom and Germany.  Australia has  some of the best research universities in the world - including the University of Queensland, Sydney and Melbourne - as well as the globally recognised CSIRO, and scores of other medical research organisations working on the development of new medical and biotechnologies every day. Very strong venture capital firms are investing in these innovations as are we at VentureCrowd. It is pleasing that the government is right behind this sector with a number of very supportive tax and policy measures which are creating really fertile ground for the growth of the Australian biotech sector. There’s no doubt Australia is well placed to continue to be a global leader in biotech into the future.

                            </p>
                            <h4> <strong>EngeneIC: “Most Innovative BioTech Company in Australia”</strong> </h4>
                            <p>
                                The company exciting the VentureCrowd team at the moment is an Australian biotech called <b>EngeneIC</b>, which has created a proprietary nanocell platform (drug delivery platform) which can be loaded with different payloads (a highly potent and highly toxic active pharmaceutical molecule), designed (in most cases) to kill the target cell. Phase 2 trials are currently taking place in Australia right now  and to date trials have demonstrated that the technology was able to curb tumour growth in 71% of patients and that the overall median survival rate was 3x to 9x higher in late cancer patients. So far, it’s looking very promising.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                               <b> With over 435 granted patents worldwide, EngeneIC was named “Most Innvative BioTech Company in Australia”</b> by Thompson Reuters. EngeneIC’s EDV™ nanocell platform is currently used for immune-compromised patients, such as patients with cancer, HIV and transplant patients who may not respond to current vaccines. Now, <b>EngeneIC is going beyond revolutionary oncology</b> solutions and is exploring its proprietary technology to be potentially used in vulnerable COVID-19 patients and other future viral pandemics, with human trials already in the plans.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                This is a very promising Australian biotech working on some really important global challenges and is a Pre-IPO offer which we will be on the VentureCrowd platform next week.  <b>EngeneIC  is planning to list on the NASDAQ in Q1 or Q2 of next year</b>, and this round is being offered at 15 to 30% discount to the IPO price. VentureCrowd expects this round to close very quickly, and anyone who is interested can find out more on our website. If you’ve ever wanted to cure cancer and COVID this may be your chance!
