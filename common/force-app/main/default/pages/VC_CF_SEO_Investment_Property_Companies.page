An exit is typically a trade sale (i.e. when a company or property development is sold) or via an initial public offering (IPO) on the stock market. Successful early-stage opportunities can offer very </span><a href="https://www.venturecrowd.com.au/s/high-return-investments"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high return investments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and so may look extremely attractive, however, as with all investments they also carry risk.

                              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To further mitigate the risk to early-stage investment portfolios, it may be worth considering an investment strategy like spreading your investment capital over many different early-stage companies and to expect about 90% of the returns you make to come from approximately 10% of your portfolio. This means that the diversification of your early-stage investment portfolio is critical in capturing the 10% of early-stage companies which may generate 90% of your returns.</span></p>
