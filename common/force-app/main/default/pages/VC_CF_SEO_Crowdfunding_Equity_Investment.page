Crowdfunding  </h3>
                            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crowdfunding has changed the way you can raise capital when starting a business venture. Traditionally, if you wanted to raise money to launch a new product or startup business, you would need to pitch your idea to a bank, venture capital firm or another financial institution, or approach a wealthy individual who was interested in </span><a href="{!$Label.VC_CF_Public_URL + '/vc-cf-seo-angel-investing'}"><span style="font-weight: 400;">angel investing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

                            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crowdfunding is a way for entrepreneurs to raise capital for a new business venture from a large number of individual investors who are willing to invest in your startup or idea. Rather than just finding one or two large investors, crowdfunding involves a ‘crowd’ of investors. There are a few different types of crowdfunding including donation-based crowdfunding, reward-based crowdfunding and equity crowdfunding. With donation-based crowdfunding, there is no financial gain to those providing the funds. This form of crowdfunding is often used by charities or for fundraising for disaster relief. Reward-based crowdfunding is when you receive a product or service from the startup business rather than money. Equity-based crowdfunding is where investors take equity in a business in exchange for a cash investment. </span></p>

                           <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several crowdfunding platforms available, each with different goals, guidelines and target markets. VentureCrowd is an equity crowdfunding platform, so rather than receiving a product or simply making a donation, if you invest in one of our deals you will receive equity or ownership in the company that is raising the capital or in the underlying property development asset. VentureCrowd is a multi-asset class crowdfunding platform that provides investors with direct access to handpicked investment opportunities in alternative assets that have traditionally been linked to specialised lenders or institutional investors. Whether you are an established business owner, an entrepreneur or a property developer, we provide alternative finance from a pool of investors across Australia. Not only will your investment come with lower fees and capital commitments, but it will also come with reduced deal complexity, and you’ll have access to alternative equity, property and credit opportunities on the same terms as professional lead investors.</span></p>

Crowdfunding gives you a wider audience which is not only a great way to raise more capital, but it also streamlines the process and will save you time. You won’t need to approach each investor individually, and you’ll only need one pitch. It is also a good way to refine your ideas as potential investors can provide useful feedback while you are developing your product or business. Your investors are also likely to give you free word-of-mouth advertising.&nbsp;</span></p>
