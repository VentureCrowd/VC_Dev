                    Equity based crowdfunding allows investors to take equity in a business in exchange for a cash investment. As a registered VentureCrowd investor, you can invest
                    in our pre-screened deals directly or via a trust managed by VentureCrowd.

                    VentureCrowd is an equity crowdfunding platform which means rather than receiving a product or making a donation the investor receives equity, or ownership, in
                    the company raising capital or the underlying property development.

                    The term ‘early-stage securities’ generally refers to shares, or securities that are convertible into shares, in companies that are at an early stage of their
                    development.
                  </p>
                  <p>This usually means the company has developed a new product or business idea, but has little (or no) revenue.</p>
                  <p>
                    Early stage securities are a high-risk high-return growth asset. The benefit of investing in companies at this early stage is that the price of the shares will
                    be low (relative to more mature companies), allowing early investors to benefit from high levels of growth if the company is successful.

                    Investing at an early stage is where the greatest risk resides. For example, the technology may need further development, the management team need to capable of
