            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much money a venture capitalist will earn can vary significantly between different investment opportunities. What they earn will depend on how well the business they invest in does, but there are also other factors to consider such as the management fees. Venture Capitalists usually make their money on ‘exit’ which is typically when the company or property development is sold, or through an initial public offering (IPO) on the stock market. The returns from early-stage investments can be very high if there is a successful exit, but they also carry risk. This is why you should typically have no more than 10% of your assets in early-stage investments and you should adopt a portfolio approach which means investing in several different early-stage companies to spread the risk.&nbsp;</span></p>

If retail investors meet certain criteria, they are now able to invest up to $10,000 in private companies. These changes mean that startup investment is no longer just for venture capitalists and limited to </span><a href="https://www.venturecrowd.com.au/s/angel-investing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">angel investing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but is much more accessible to the everyday investor.
