                <h3> Venture Capital </h3>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The history of venture capital as a form of investment for emerging technologies and new businesses dates back to the middle of last century when Goerges Doriot, the “Father of Venture Capital”, established the American Research and Development Corporation (ARD) devoted to funding new technologies commercialised after the second world war. Today it’s one of the most exciting investment areas, offering investors the opportunity to back the ideas and technologies which inspire them. Whether you’re interested in </span><a href="https://www.venturecrowd.com.au/s/angel-investing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">angel investing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and looking for a new startup to invest in or you’re an entrepreneur with an amazing idea, VentureCrowd can help you find the investment opportunities that you’re looking for using our simple online platform and fuss-free investment process.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with any kind of investment, venture capital investments are not without their risks. Before you launch into any new investment opportunity, it’s always a good idea to sit down with a professional financial planner or advisor to run through your options. New businesses and innovations can still fail in the marketplace, no matter how brilliant they may appear to be. The key to ensuring that you mitigate the risk of potential failed investments is through diversification of your portfolio. We offer a range of different investment opportunities. For example, as one of Australia’s investment property companies, we offer investors and developers access to </span><a href="https://www.venturecrowd.com.au/s/property/funds"><span style="font-weight: 400;">property funds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like </span><a href="https://www.venturecrowd.com.au/s/property/gold-coast"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold Coast property investment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.venturecrowd.com.au/s/property/brisbane"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brisbane property investment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As a general rule, investors can expect to derive 90% of their investment income from approximately 10% of their investment portfolio which means that diversifying your portfolio is vital.</span></p>

            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A term sheet is a non-binding agreement that details the basic terms and conditions of an individual investment. From the term sheet a more formal, legally binding document is written once all parties involved reach an agreement. They are general cover sheets that include the significant aspects of an investment and not every minor contingency which may arise. Once all major parties agree on the terms of the investment as outlined within the term sheet, the more expensive legal work can begin. </span></p>
