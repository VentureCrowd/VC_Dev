                                Hosting the Olympics can elevate a city’s profile on the global stage and attract new foreign investment, entertainment and
                                sporting events, and increase net migration. In this article we will look at how Brisbane’s
                                Olympics win will boost the Queensland economy and the opportunities that emerge for investors,
                                particularly in the property sector.

                                <p>
                                    At VentureCrowd, we’re big fans of Brisbane and South East Queensland.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    There’s a really interesting startup and innovation ecosystem there, world class universities and research institutions like the University of Queensland, and of course natural wonders that are the envy of the world.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Brisbane also has some of the best restaurants and hospitality venues in the country, including what we think is arguably Australia’s most beautiful piece of hospitality architecture, the Carlile hotel. Shout out to our friends at Hellenika, Yoko and Julius restaurants, and those fine baristas at Industry Beans in Newstead that make every morning special.
                                </p> 
                                <p>
                                    But the best thing about Brisbane is that for all its emerging sophistication, the people have managed to retain their country town friendliness. You can walk along the river in the middle of the city and people you don’t know will nod and smile, and we hope that’s something Brisbane never loses.
                                </p>

                                    The announcement of the Olympics is great news for Brisbane and South East Queensland, it’s certainly going to ramp up economic activity across most sectors and that is excellent news for investors.

                                    Brisbane and South East Queensland have been on the rise for some time and we think this announcement really cements the opportunity for the region to come into its own over the next 10 years.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For an estimated cost of $5 bn, KPMG is forecasting an $8.1 billion injection to the Qld economy, $17.6 bn into the wider Australian economy and the creation of 100,000 new jobs.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There are also forecasts that suggest there will be: 
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            $8.6 billion in increased export opportunities, 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            over $20 billion in international tourist expenditure,
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            and nearly $700 billion to be spent on infrastructure projects
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In addition to that you’ve got the power of positive consumer and community sentiment, which is very difficult to measure but is an incredibly important element of economic stimulus.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    What all this means for investors is that <b>economic growth</b> in Brisbane &amp;  South East Queensland is about to shift into overdrive, and <b>that is going to make</b> the region very attractive for investors, particularly in relation to the property sector.
                                </p>

                                    The exact details of the proposed infrastructure projects have not been fully disclosed yet, but the overall amount of money being earmarked for infrastructure across South East Queensland in the lead up to the games is about $700 million.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    What we do know is that the money will be spent on:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            building new venues and upgrading existing ones,
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            including building new athlete villages in Brisbane, the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast; and
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            upgrading road and rail networks linking the South East Queensland locations that will be venues for Olympic sports.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Whenever you inject that level of funding into any region to accelerate major city-building projects, the attraction of the region as a place to live and work also increases and it creates a ripple effect throughout the local economy which can be very powerful, and we think it will be for South East Queensland.
                                </p>
                                <div id="section4">

                                    The South East Queensland property market is already undersupplied and it is forecast to remain undersupplied for the next few years.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    With this announcement, we expect there to be an even greater increase in net domestic migration into South East Queensland and that will put even more pressure on an already undersupplied housing market.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That can be good news for investors because it means that Queensland and Brisbane housing price growth is likely to continue to be strong for some time.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But it also means that  South East Queensland will need a lot more stock and therefore investors should expect a whole range of new residential property development projects to come on line across the region.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So, if you are an investor in  South East Queensland property, you’re likely to do very well in the lead up to the Olympics. If you’re not, we think it’s worth considering.

                                    There are obviously a number of ways you can have exposure to the growth of a property market. One way is to actually buy property and another is to invest in property projects.

                                    At VentureCrowd, we do both. We’ve recently released 4 new property development projects across South East Queensland ranging from a 76 architecturally designed townhouse project in Pimpama (Gold Coast) to a 300 lot residential estate in Glenvale (West of Brisbane).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Each of those projects are at different stages of development and are funded by a syndicate of VentureCrowd members.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So if you want exposure to the South East Queensland property market, especially now, you can <a href="https://www.venturecrowd.com.au/s/property" target="_top">head to the property section in our website </a>for more information on those projects.
