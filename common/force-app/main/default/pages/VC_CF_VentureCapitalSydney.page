                <div class="wpb_wrapper">
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venture capital refers to the funds that are made available to startups or entrepreneurs who need funding to either start a new business or expand their existing business. If you register through the VentureCrowd platform, you can get easy access to curated startup and property investment opportunities. You’ll then be able to do your research, speak with the founders and when you are ready to invest, you can pay seamlessly via our fully online and automated platform. You will then receive ownership and visibility of your investment online. If the company you have invested in is successful, you can then share in their success. If you are worried about the quality of our investments, we don’t just list any deal on the platform. They are all subject to our rigorous curation process and as VentureCrowd is investor-led, we only list deals with secured professional external leads or a VentureCrowd approved partner.&nbsp;</span></p>

        <div class="wpb_wrapper">
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The returns on venture capital will vary between different investment opportunities. It will depend on the growth and profitability of the business you invest in and how long the investment is made for. The return in the investment is made on ‘exit’ or ‘liquidity event’. This is usually when the property development or business is sold, or through an initial public offering (IPO) on the stock market. The returns from successful early-stage investments can be very high, but these investment opportunities also come with a high risk.</span></p>

            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The venture capital market is changing so it is now easier to get involved in venture capital in Sydney. Traditionally a company wanting to raise funds via retail crowdsource funding opportunities had to be structured as a public company (unlisted) but in September 2017, legislation changed extending the crowdsource funding opportunities to proprietary companies. The new rules allow private companies to not count crowd-sourced funding investors towards the 50-shareholder cap. With the new legislation comes additional governance and reporting obligations that are designed to protect investors.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And recent changes have made it easier for investors too. Changes to Australian legislation in 2017 mean that investment opportunities that had previously only been available to high net worth individuals or sophisticated investors can now be accessed by retail investors. Retail investors who meet certain criteria are now able to invest up to $10,000 in private companies. This means startup investment is no longer just for venture capitalists or </span><a href="https://www.venturecrowd.com.au/s/angel-investing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">angel investing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but is more accessible to everyday investors who can now co-invest on the same economic terms alongside experienced lead investors. This means that investors can now have direct access to alternative investment opportunities that have previously been limited to institutional or sophisticated investors.</span></p>
