            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To create a successful startup, you generally need an initial cash injection, so what are the best ways of raising these funds in Melbourne? There are several different methods of venture capital financing to consider. Firstly, you can try finding family or friends who may want to invest in your business or see how much of your own money you can make available for your new venture. One of the advantages of dealing with family and friends is that they know you already so they may consider it to be less risky than investing elsewhere, but bringing personal relationships and business relationships together can be complex. You’ll need to make sure you have a written agreement and everyone is clear on the specific details and expectations. You may also be eligible to apply for a government grant, but these can be very competitive. Another option is to take out a small business loan, although a business loan is not always easy to get due to the high-risks associated with a startup.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

        <div class="wpb_wrapper">
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One popular way to get startup funding is through venture capital funds. This involves groups such as super funds or other high-net-worth individuals investing in venture funds managed by investors. Venture capitalists look for startup businesses who they think will have high growth potential, or they may have a specialised area and will look for businesses in that particular sector. Their experience will mean they can add value and work closely with the business. Some new businesses look for an angel investor. </span><a href="https://www.venturecrowd.com.au/s/angel-investing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angel investing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is where a high-net-worth individual invests in the early stages of a startup.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VentureCrowd has been successfully raising capital for wholesale investors for over three years. Dues to changes in Australian legislation, individuals can now invest smaller amounts of money into a startup, and these retail investors can share in the journey of the business, as well as the equity. </span></p>

                <h3> Why is venture capital in Melbourne better than a bank loan? </h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equity-based crowdfunding gives investors equity in a business in exchange for a cash investment. This can be more attractive than borrowing money through bank loans, especially for early-stage companies for several reasons. Firstly, bank loan debts generally need to be paid back in regular payments over a specific time period, with interest, which can be difficult when a business is first starting. Investors, on the other hand, are speculating that the value of their investment will grow as the company develops. Due to the high-risk nature of getting a bank loan for a startup, it may not be very easy to secure a bank loan even if you want one. Unlike a bank, the investor has a more vested interest in the company doing well, so they can often provide advice and share from their extensive business experience.</span></p>
