Syndicate investing allows individual investors to co-invest with others to lessen the risk and invest in something bigger and better than they would otherwise be able to do.&nbsp;</span></p>

                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several benefits of syndicate investing. By being able to invest with smaller amounts of capital makes it easier to diversify your investments by spreading your investment across different syndicates which helps minimise the risks. For investors, it allows them to discover investment opportunities in startups and property that they may not have otherwise discovered or been able to afford to invest in. If you have less experience as an investor, investing in a syndicate allows you to tap into the knowledge and experience of others with who you are co-investing with and they can provide you with valuable advice. One advantage for startups involved in syndicate investing is that it allows them access to more capital and it also means rather than negotiating with different investors they can raise their money through one body.&nbsp;</span></p>

Firstly, you’ll need to look at your financial situation and see how much money you can afford to invest. This will depend on your savings, expenses, income, and other debt amongst other things. You’ll need to then work out the time period you would like to invest your money for and what your end goals are. Once you have determined this, you’ll be in a better position to look at the different syndicate investing opportunities that are available and choose the financial strategy that is best for your situation. Other factors to consider include the level of risk you are willing to take, how the investment is structured, the experience of the property syndicate management team and whether they have undertaken the appropriate due diligence.</span></p>
