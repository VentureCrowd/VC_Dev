                            </h1> <br></br>
                            <p>Impact investing has been growing in popularity in recent years, but what does it involve? Unlike standard investments, which tend to be solely focused on returns, these types of investments are made to generate both a <a href="https://thegiin.org/impact-investing/need-to-know/#what-is-impact-investing"> financial return and positive, measurable social and environmental impacts.</a></p>
          
                            <!-- Dropdowns -->

                    <h2 class="text-background-gradient mt-5">What is impact investing?</h2>
               
                      <p>An impact investment can be made in any type of economy, from developed to emerging. Investors may target any kind of rate of return, including below-market and concessionary returns, and not only the high-performing ones. Areas of focus can include sustainable farming and food production, renewable energy, and environmental protection.</p>
                      <p>Impact investing is also active in community projects, such as providing microfinancing and addressing affordability for essentials like housing, which might include building quality family homes. Other essential services include healthcare and education. Impact investing can go beyond social and environmental to finance startups that help businesses function more effectively and achieve their goals.</p>
                      <p>So impact investing clearly has a broad scope of focus, but why is it important and how has crowdfunding played a role in this area? We explore these questions and consider some successful examples and the profitability of impact investing before looking at the future of impact investing. </p>

       
              <h2 class="text-background-gradient mt-5">Why is impact investing important?</h2>

                    <p>Impact investing is important as it directs investment capital to projects and organisations concerned with social and environmental ends, for the good of the community. For investment individuals, it’s an avenue for generating financial returns while supporting social, environmental, and community goals.</p>
                    <p>For example, healthcare is <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/02/25/impact-investing-fund-cancer-cures/"> ranked seventh</a> among sectors receiving the most capital from impact investors. Impact investors and their capital can be used to boost research in this vital area, and possibly support faster development of treatments and personalised treatments and cures for cancer. In addition to extending lifespans and saving lives, this could create faster treatments with fewer side effects from treatment. Further, research suggests impact investing works, as the vast majority of investments fulfilled expectations for both financial returns and social impact. </p>
                   <p>Impact investing offers an alternative to the charity model and turns on its head the idea that social and environmental goals can only be resolved by the charity or non-profit sector, or government. It also challenges the idea that for-profit efforts must be separate from social and environmental ones. As such, it provides investors, especially socially conscious investors, with more options for investing their capital.</p>
                   <p>Additionally, as it offers financial returns, more investors could be attracted to impact investing and enable these funds, organisations, and projects to attract more funds and grow their endowments more than they otherwise could. Finally, in addition to investors and entrepreneurs benefitting, consumers can also benefit from the novel, more affordable, and better solutions that impact investing could help realise.</p>
                   <p> As an indication of the level of scale needed to fund social and environmental ventures, the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals</a> targets issues ranging from poverty and hunger to sanitation and climate change. An estimated several trillion dollars per year are needed to fulfil these goals, and governments and the charity sector do not have the capital to address these funding needs. The answer is the private sector. While the current impact investing market has USD$715 billion under management, in future years, this could grow to the trillions needed to meet the UN’s stated targets.</p>

              <h2 class="text-background-gradient mt-5">The rise of crowdfunding in impact investing</h2> 
        
              <br> </br> 
              <p>Equity crowdfunding allows the average individual investor to invest directly in startups, including those with an impact-investing or use <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/impact-investing">environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) factors</a> as guiding principles. The investor could invest as little as $100 and gain an ownership interest in the impact-investing venture. Investors don’t necessarily need the networks and a large amount of capital required for traditional investment channels. For demographics like millennials who value social and environmental outcomes as much as financial returns, this has significant implications.</p>
              <p>In a <a href="https://medium.com/ivey-business-review/equity-crowdfunding-the-future-of-impact-investing-b36651eeecb2">number of countries,</a> equity crowdfunding is already being successfully used to drive early-stage impact-investing ventures. For countries like Canada, where there’s a significant capital gap impeding wider uptake of impact investing, crowdfunding can serve as a solution for both generating capital and making new investment opportunities easier to find for investors. The crowdfunding model can connect investors with ventures, allowing socially conscious investors interested in ESG or impact-investing investments to find opportunities matching their expected levels for financial returns.</p>
              <p>The crowdfunding model allows ventures and projects to release investment funds from the private sector. It doesn’t so much supplant existing investing channels as complement them, especially for early-stage ventures, in fostering them before they reach the growth stage. This is particularly significant as many early stage venture startups find it challenging to access<a href="https://www.inspiringcapital.ly/articles/equity-crowdfunding-a-new-world-of-fundraising-and-impact-investing/"> traditional venture or angel investment.</a></p>
              <p>At the same time, the crowdfunding process can help the impact venture gain a strong following and user base while generating buzz, traction, and publicity. The ownership-sharing model can generate loyalty through building a community of owners. The investor-owners can enjoy a transparent process, with clear expectations. Ultimately, crowdfunding could be used to encourage more people to invest and ignite a cycle by encouraging more founding of ESG ventures. This then generates more opportunities for investors.</p>
    
       
              <h2 class="text-background-gradient mt-5">How to start impact investing</h2> 
              <br> </br> 
                    <p>You have many options when it comes to making a difference through impact investing. As an investor, you can look for index funds or exchange traded funds that vet companies and only invest in those with social and environmental goals or those that meet certain ESG criteria. You could also invest in individual stocks in companies that match ESG principles. Alternatively, if you have plenty of money to invest, you could look into signing up as a client with a venture capital fund that invests in social enterprises. You could also explore <a href="https://www.venturecrowd.com.au/s/"> equity crowdfunding platforms like VentureCrowd</a> to find suitable impact investing ventures.</p>
                    <p>Impact investing has already attracted the interest of a broad range of investors. Those investors and institutions active in the area include institutional investors like fund managers, financial institutions and banks, development finance groups, and pension funds and insurance companies. Family offices, private foundations, religious institutions, NGOS, and individual investors have also invested in impact investing projects. These are all potential avenues for those interested in impact investing to get started.</p>
                    
              

           
                <h2 class="text-background-gradient mt-5">Examples of sustainable impact investing</h2> 
                  <br> </br> <p> Sustainable impact investing has already seen a range of successes in social and environmental priorities</p>  

                <p>For example, equity crowdfunding has enabled impactful ventures to develop cutting-edge climate technologies such as <a href="https://www.venturecrowd.com.au/s/invest/ventures/wave-swell-energy"> Wave Swell Energy, </a> which is generating clean energy from ocean waves. This is critical as the world requires more renewable energy, and the focus on the COP26 event in Glasgow is clear evidence of this. Extreme weather events have increased over 5x in the last decade, costing trillions of dollars to the global economy. As a result, investments to tackle climate change were recently committed by the world's top financial institution at an estimated value of <a href="https://www.gfanzero.com/press/amount-of-finance-committed-to-achieving-1-5c-now-at-scale-needed-to-deliver-the-transition/"> USD $130 trillion </a> for the coming years.</p> 
                <p>Other impact investing ventures have been active in <a href="https://www.venturecrowd.com.au/s/invest/ventures/engeneic"> accelerating the fight against cancer.</a> These investments have been spearheaded by a new generation of philanthropists who built their wealth in the tech sector. These investments have led to <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/12/impact-investing-could-accelerate-the-fight-against-cancer">significant advances in precision medicine and immunotherapy </a> for treating and even the potential curing of many cancers. <a href="https://www.venturecrowd.com.au/s/invest/ventures/engeneic"> Precision medicine</a> enables healthcare providers to tailor treatments to the patient’s genetic profile, lifestyle, and disease. In the future, these impact-investment-funded research ventures could lead to faster cures and more cancers becoming chronic rather than terminal conditions. 
               </p>
                    <p> Impact investing has also made a mark in helping create a <a href="https://www.venturecrowd.com.au/s/property"> more sustainable future in real estate.</a> Investors with holdings in the real estate sector understand they can make a difference to the environment by choosing sustainable, low-carbon investments in the area. Residents and corporate tenants are also conscious about their environmental impact and they value carbon-neutral houses and commercial real estate. Governments are also increasingly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelicakrystledonati/2021/10/19/esg-proptech-trends-for-a-sustainable-future-in-real-estate/?sh=1a994c6b3109"> developing policies and laws</a>  to minimise carbon emissions. Impact investing can target proptech startups that are already helping track and report carbon wastage and energy consumption. 
                    </p>
<p>
Other types of proptech ventures of interest to impact investors are platforms that enable consumers to more easily access renewable energy. These tech tools could also provide more data about usage for consumers and corporate customers to help them make smarter energy-consumption choices. For example, platforms that offer sensor-derived data to automatically adjust the HVAC system for greater efficiency. Others ideas could be carbon capture during the construction phase, which a number of startups have already delved into.

<p>
The Rockefeller Foundation has invested in funds that provide housing, schools, and job training to those with disabilities. Other ways investors are engaging with impact investing opportunities include through institutions like the Bank of America, Capital One, and Wells Fargo which invest in nonprofit lenders that in turn lend to nonprofits and startups. Impact investors are also <a href="https://gfi.org/blog/cultivating-a-better-future-with-impact-investing/"> increasingly interested in the alternative proteins space,</a> 
 which has the potential to drastically reduce the environmental impact associated with animal proteins while enhancing food security.

              <h2 class="text-background-gradient mt-5">Impact investing financial returns - is impact investing profitable?</h2> 
           
              <br> </br>  <p>Impact investing can indeed be profitable. <a href="https://thegiin.org/impact-investing/need-to-know/#what-is-impact-investing"> According to investor surveys,</a> impact-investment portfolios meet or surpass expectations. This is in terms of both financial returns and social and environmental impacts, and for investments in emerging and developed markets, and all investments as a whole. Note some impact investors will expect below-market-rate returns while others expect better-than-market returns.</p> 
             
              <h2 class="text-background-gradient mt-5">
                The future of impact investing
                </h2> 
                <p>Impact investing has been described as both an industry and a movement, one that could <a href="https://thegiin.org/assets/GIIN_Roadmap%20for%20the%20Future%20of%20Impact%20Investing.pdf"> potentially revolutionise the role of financial markets.</a> Financial markets could be more focused on social needs and the community good. In the future, money and business could be more closely tied to social and environmental goals. That is, impact investing could eventually become a mainstream force in catalysing certain changes. These could include ensuring more investments are concentrated on bringing about positive changes for societies and communities, and for the public good, such as environmental efforts.</p>
                
                <p>Within this future scenario, the rise of impact investing could lead to more investors assessing investment opportunities on the basis of their potential for the social good as well as their financial returns. As more investors feel empowered to invest to effect positive change, the more a beneficial cycle of investment opportunities and capital inflows can gather pace.</p> 
               <p>At some point, impact investing could reach a massive scale and even become a major player within the financial sector in terms of assets under management or volume of capital deployed. At the same time, the industry can continue to attract more capital by offering reliable impact and financial data demonstrate viability. It can continue to explore different enablers, such as equity crowdfunding, to make it easier for average investors to find and make impact investments that match their own values. </p>

                Impact investing with VentureCrowd
                </h3> 
                <br> </br>  <p>Impact investing has the potential to transform how money and investments are directed to social and environmental purposes. Currently, government and charity sector money isn’t enough to achieve the level of public good envisaged by initiatives like the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals. However, especially when enabled by powerful channels like crowdfunding, impact investing can see more average investors to become involved and potentially create enormous scale in the volume of money directed into impact investment and the variety of impact investing ventures. 
                </p>
